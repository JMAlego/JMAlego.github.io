      <h3>Writer of Code, User of Maths, Player of Games and Piano</h3>
      <p>I'm an IT student currently attending York College, I've been using computers since I was tiny and I've been coding since I was thirteen or fourteen, so it's safe to say I have some experience in the field of computing.</p>
      <p>When I'm not at college I'm either coding, reading a book, playing a game or playing the piano.</p>
